            <h2>Hi I'm Nahidul Islam</h2>
            <h6>I recently completed my bachelor's degree in computer science and engineering. I wish to work as a Software Engineer within two or three months. To achieve this, I've been studying and giving it my all, something I've never done before. I'm now enrolled in the Programming Hero web course and the Algo Expert course. In sha Allah, I shall achieve my aim within a few months.</h6>
